[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/48da266e-9a1b-40ef-b6d0-88c12dfb0722/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/digital-pocket-operators/deploys)

I'm recreating Teenage Engineering's Pocket Operators (starting with PO28 Robot).

## Demo

If you'd like to see what I've done, this is a [demo](https://digital-pocket-operators.netlify.com/)

## Development

It's built with React, uses Parcel as a bundler and uses mobx for global reactivity and such.

You can run the project locally on [http://localhost:1234](http://localhost:1234) using

`npm run dev`

or build the project with

`npm run build`

## Thanks for reading

Ok, hope that was fun. Byeeeee 👋🏻
